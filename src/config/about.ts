    `Hey there, my name is Pedro. I'm an indie game developer based in Brazil. Passionate about technology since the age of 9, I am a full-stack developer and indie game creator with a keen eye for detail, particularly in optimization and third-party system integration. I began programming at 14 and truly immersed myself in development at 16 when I joined the CEDUP IT technical course.`,
    `Since 2014, I've been actively studying game development using the deprecated Blender Game Engine and Unity 4. In 2016, after starting my course, I shifted my focus to web development while maintaining game development as a hobby. In 2021, I was hired as a full-stack developer at Tecimob, followed by a role at Hotels at Home in 2023. Despite these positions, my dream of becoming a dedicated game developer never faded, and now I have decided to fully pursue it.`,
